Original macros written by Rich
- [mod_RR_PasteImage.bas](mod_RR_PasteImage.bas)

I then wrote my own
- [mod_AH_ResizeShapes.bas](mod_AH_ResizeShapes.bas)

`ResizePicture_AH()`, after selecting the pic run this macro to resize, so everything was consistent.

- [modChangeFont.bas](modChangeFont.bas)

Select some text and run `ChangeFont()`

A lot of time I liked to change the colour of the Application I was talking about to empahise
`ChangeColourAccess()`, `ChangeColourWord()`, `ChangeColourOutlook()`, `Capitalise()`

Originally when writing these I was discussing them with a colleague who suggested a few alternatives.
- [mod_JW_Resize.bas](mod_JW_Resize.bas)
`ShrinkImg()`

The macro recorder is a great way to learn how to do actions, record away then view what code is output and incorporate in your scripts.
